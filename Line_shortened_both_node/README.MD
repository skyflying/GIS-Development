To get the shortened line from both end nodes based on the original line,

1. Reads the Shapefile.
2. Extracts the start and end points of each line segment and outputs them as a new Shapefile.
3. Shortens each end of the line segments by X meters(Initial X =100m) and outputs them as a new Shapefile.
